Pilot Area Analyzer

Overview:
The Pilot Area Analyzer is a Java-based application that calculates and records the sizes of areas patrolled by pilots. It reads pilot route data from pilotinfo.txt, performs area calculations, and writes the results into pilot_areas.txt.

Files in the Repository
Main.java: The main Java program that executes the area calculations.
Main.txt: Appears to be a duplicate of Main.java. Verify if this is required or a backup.
pilotinfo.txt: Input file containing raw data of pilot routes in a specific format.
pilot_areas.txt: Output file where the calculated area for each pilot is stored.

How It Works:
Input (pilotinfo.txt): Contains pilot route data in a pre-defined format.
Process: The Main class in Main.java reads the input file, calculates the area covered by each pilot using the provided route data, and then writes the calculated areas to the output file.
Output (pilot_areas.txt): Stores the name of each pilot alongside the calculated area of their patrol route.

Usage:

1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Compile Main.java:
3. Run the compiled program:
4. The program reads pilotinfo.txt and writes the results to pilot_areas.txt.
